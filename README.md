# ReconSpider-HTB
ReconSpider.py web enumeration script provided by HackTheBox.

## Requirements

This script requires the Python library `scrapy`.

On Kali, you can get this by running:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-scrapy
```

In other distros that still utilize `pip3`, you may be able to install it with:

```bash
pip3 install scrapy
```
